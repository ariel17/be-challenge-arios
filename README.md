# Backend challenge by Ariel Gerardo RÃ­os (that's me!)

## Start services with docker-compose
It is REQUIRED to change `FOOTBALL_APIKEY` environment variable value in
`docker-compose.yml` file. Once started, it can take a few moments up be ready
since it builds + tests + waits for database to be ready to accept connections.

```
docker-compose up
```

## Example usage
```
# enqueues data import process for Premier League competition
curl -X POST --data '{"code":"PL"}' http://localhost:8080/importer
